## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Testing & Simulation Execution Rules ‚ö†Ô∏è

### üö® IMPORTANT: User-Driven Testing Only üö®
**THE USER PERFORMS ALL SIMULATION TESTS - AI MUST NOT RUN SIMULATIONS**

1. **NEVER execute simulation commands** (e.g., curl for /simulation/step)
2. **WAIT for user to provide logs** from their testing
3. **ANALYZE logs provided by user** and suggest fixes
4. **NO automated testing** - this saves tokens and provides real-world results

**Why this approach:**
- User has the actual runtime environment
- Saves significant API tokens and time
- More accurate real-world testing results
- User can observe visual UI behavior

### When User Reports Issues:
1. **Ask user to provide the log file** or relevant log excerpts
2. **Analyze the provided logs** to identify issues
3. **Suggest code fixes** based on log analysis
4. **Wait for user to test** the fixes and provide feedback

### üîç Debug Strategy:
- **Focus on the latest logs** rather than initial logs
- **Analyze current state** from the most recent log entries
- **Make targeted fixes** based on the specific issues shown in logs
- **Avoid obsessing over initial state** - work with what's currently happening

## Project Overview

Vue.js 3 + FastAPI Ï†úÏ°∞ Í≥µÏ†ï ÏãúÎÆ¨Î†àÏù¥ÏÖò - A high-performance manufacturing process simulation web application that allows users to visually design and simulate manufacturing processes using drag-and-drop blocks and connectors.

## Development Commands

### Frontend (Vue.js 3 + Vite)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev          # Start development server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### Backend (FastAPI + SimPy)
```bash
cd backend

# Virtual environment setup (first time)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run server
source venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Or use the script
./run_backend.sh
```

### Backend Server Logging
**Log File Location**: `backend/logs/backend_server.log`
- Auto-created on server start
- Fresh log for each server restart
- 200 line limit with rotation (keeps last 100 lines)
- Contains server events, API calls, simulation debug logs
- Reset on simulation reset via `/simulation/reset`
- **Primary debugging tool** - Always check logs when issues occur
- Log format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - logger_name - LEVEL - message`

## Architecture Overview

### Backend Architecture - Simple Engine v3 (Current)
**Revolutionary change**: 90% code reduction from previous architecture

**Core Files:**
- `app/simple_simulation_engine.py` - Main engine orchestration
- `app/simple_block.py` - Independent block objects with self-contained logic
- `app/simple_entity.py` - Lightweight entity representation
- `app/simple_signal_manager.py` - Direct signal state management
- `app/simple_script_executor.py` - Script command ‚Üí function mapping
- `app/simple_engine_adapter.py` - API compatibility layer

**Architecture Principles:**
1. **Block Independence**: Each block runs its own SimPy process
2. **Script-Driven**: All behavior defined in scripts, not hardcoded
3. **Batch Processing**: Scripts execute sequentially until entity movement
4. **Direct Functions**: Each command maps to a simple function
5. **Zero Manager Dependencies**: No complex inter-manager communications

### Frontend Architecture
**Key Components:**
- `App.vue` - Main application orchestrator
- `components/CanvasArea.vue` - Konva.js-based visual simulation
- `components/shared/SettingsBase.vue` - Unified settings interface
- `components/shared/ActionEditor.vue` - Action/script editing
- Composables: `useSimulation`, `useBlocks`, `useSignals` - State management

**Entity Visualization:**
- Orange squares with numbers in blocks
- Purple squares during transit between blocks
- Global entity ID ‚Üí number mapping for consistent display

## Script Syntax

### Commands
```
delay 5                           # Wait 5 seconds
Ïã†Ìò∏Î™Ö = true                     # Set signal
wait Ïã†Ìò∏Î™Ö = true                # Wait for signal
wait A = true or B = true         # OR condition wait
if Ïã†Ìò∏Î™Ö = true                  # Conditional (indent sub-actions)
go to Î∏îÎ°ùÎ™Ö.Ïª§ÎÑ•ÌÑ∞Î™Ö             # Move to another block
go to Î∏îÎ°ùÎ™Ö.Ïª§ÎÑ•ÌÑ∞Î™Ö,3           # Move with 3s transit delay
go from Ïª§ÎÑ•ÌÑ∞Î™Ö to Î∏îÎ°ùÎ™Ö.Ïª§ÎÑ•ÌÑ∞Î™Ö,3  # Move from specific connector (recommended)
jump to 1                         # Jump to line 1
// comment                        # Comment line

# Entity Attribute Commands (NEW)
product type += flip(red)         # Add 'flip' attribute and set color to red
product type += flip,1c(blue)     # Add multiple attributes and set color
product type += (green)           # Change color only without adding attributes
product type -= flip              # Remove 'flip' attribute
product type -= flip,1c           # Remove multiple attributes
product type -= (default)         # Reset color to default

# Attribute Conditions
if product type = flip            # Check single attribute
if product type = flip or 1c      # Check OR condition
if product type = flip and 1c     # Check AND condition
if product type = transit         # Check transit state

wait product type = transit       # Wait for transit state
wait product type = flip          # Wait for attribute
wait product type = flip or 1c    # Wait with OR condition
wait product type = flip and 1c   # Wait with AND condition
```

### Example Script
```
wait Í≥µÏ†ï1 load enable = true or Í≥µÏ†ï2 load enable = true
if Í≥µÏ†ï1 load enable = true
    Í≥µÏ†ï1 load enable = false
    go from R to Í≥µÏ†ï1.L,3
if Í≥µÏ†ï2 load enable = true
    Í≥µÏ†ï2 load enable = false
    go from R to Í≥µÏ†ï2.L,3
```

## Key Technical Details

### ID Type Handling
- All IDs are converted to strings for consistency
- Frontend and backend handle both numeric and string IDs seamlessly
- Comparison uses `String(id1) === String(id2)` pattern

### Entity Number Display
- Uses global `Map<entityId, number>` for consistent numbering
- Numbers persist across entity movements
- Reset only when simulation resets (entity count = 0)

### Script Type Actions
- Blocks can have either `actions` array or `script` field
- Script field automatically converted to script type action
- Script editor supports both viewing and editing scripts

### Step Execution
- Each step = one entity movement (not one action)
- Multiple actions execute within single step until `go to`
- Event-based stepping ensures realistic time progression

### Connector Management
- **Add Connectors**: Use "+" button in block settings
- **Delete Connectors**: Red "üóëÔ∏è Ïª§ÎÑ•ÌÑ∞ ÏÇ≠Ï†ú" button in connector settings
- **Move Connectors**: Drag blue dotted circle when connector is selected
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Deleting connector removes all related connections and script references

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Entity Numbers Changing
- **Cause**: Local entity mapping recreated each update
- **Solution**: Use global `globalEntityIdToNumber` Map

### Scripts Not Visible in Editor
- **Cause**: Missing script type handling
- **Solution**: Added script type to ActionEditor and conversion functions

### Source Block Not Creating Entities
- **Cause**: Script conditions not met or capacity full
- **Solution**: Check signals and block capacity

### Entities Stuck in Transit
- **Cause**: Destination block full or missing process
- **Solution**: Check block capacity and ensure all blocks have processes

## Performance Considerations

### Debug Mode
- Location: `backend/app/core/constants.py` (if using old engine)
- Simple engine has built-in debug logging
- Production: Minimal logging for 22,000+ steps/sec
- Debug: Detailed logging ~1,000 steps/sec

### Frontend Optimization
- Partial rendering with dirty flags
- Entity updates batched
- Canvas operations minimized

## Important Development Rules

1. **Never run simulations internally** - User provides logs
2. **Script-centric design** - Avoid hardcoding logic
3. **Maintain API compatibility** - Use adapter pattern
4. **Entity ID consistency** - Always convert to strings
5. **Global state for persistence** - Entity numbers, signals
6. **Preserve existing functionality** - When adding new features, create separate modules to avoid breaking current code
7. **Intuitive script commands** - Commands should be easy to understand for non-programmers
8. **Add new functions, don't modify** - When adding script commands, create new functions instead of modifying existing ones
9. **NO HARDCODED VALUES** - All timing, delays, and configuration must come from scripts or config files
