# to keep the FastAPI endpoints and SimPy logic somewhat co-located for this example.

# As the SimPy model grows, it would be refactored into this file with:
# - Entity definitions (e.g., class Product)
# - Resource definitions (e.g., class Machine(simpy.Resource))
# - Process functions for different block types
# - Helper functions for routing, signal handling, etc.
